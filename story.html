                        he farmer’s market buzzed around him, his arms heavy with his cloth totes filled to the brim. There’d been a lovely selection of candles this morning. Now he waited among the sea of humanity in the square for the curly-haired vendor to wrap his fresh-cut flowers. An acoustic band played in the middle of the market, twangy notes bouncing off tents and muddled with the voices of the crowd. He reached . . . .

                        I woke up to a strange gurgling sound. Waves crashed into the boathouse and moved it from side to side. I assumed the noise was just normal sounds the water makes all the time. I decided to ignore it and go back to sleep. But I couldn’t. Now that I was awake, I realized how badly I had to use the . . . .

My Ma comes in and looks down on me. She looks angry. She opens the bin and makes a funny noise. I stand up and look over the edge of the bin. There’s a lot of old dark, wet and furry food. And a lot of maggots. Ma gets . . . .

“Well!” my mom shouted with glee, as she clapped her hands, “today is your first day of Kindergarten Indiana”! She looked far too excited and sounded a little too eccentric. I sat there at the breakfast table with crossed arms and an untouched plate of peanut butter and butter on toast .  

 “Cmon!” she said “Let's get you dressed . . . .

                        The first rain of the season doesn’t seem like much but the plants and flowers appreciate it. Some though find it annoying especially if they have plans that have to put on hold due to rain. Lily, on the other hand loved it when it rained because that was when the rain fairies came out. Not many could see them but Lily could. She would watch them prepare before the rain hit getting animals and insects to safety. Once the rain came Lily would watch the fairies dance and run around the droplets. Occasionally they would direct the rain to flowers or plants that needed more watering. The fairies were tiny little things that flew fast. They were a little bigger than a dragonfly, in fact . . . .

                        I’m not sure how long it was before I realized that the shuttle train never stopped, probably about the time it dawned on me that the people who had gotten on with me were gone. The train is supposed to run from Grand Central to Times Square, one stop, five minutes at the absolute most. But it had been… how long had it been? I don’t know, I was reading my book. I can space out pretty bad sometimes. Family lore has it that I slept right through a freak tornado that ripped off our roof. But the bluish fluorescent lights on the train flickered out with a hum, and . . . .

                        Journal Entry, November 18, from James Thompson: This has been going on too long now. Maybe my friends are right, and I should just move on; try to forget this ever happened. Get back out there and make an attempt at a ‘normal life.’

                        But just how does one “move on” back to regular dates or meeting up with other desperate strangers at bars, after seven magical nights with an incredible woman who seemed to strike the perfect and delicate balance between fun, spontaneity, and being serious about the things that really . . . .

                        Rain poured down on a lone hooded figure standing under a dim streetlamp in the crowded parking lot. Inside of the large domed building before him. Hidden somewhere inside of the voluminous expanse of black cloth that made up his oversized hoodie was a young boy around fourteen years of age.

It was like someone had taken the time to make the individual chimes clink together in such a way that only sung minor keys. Something told her it was going to be more trouble than it was worth to figure out who, or what, was making it. Still, she forced herself to pick her feet up and place them . . . .

The sky reflected off its many windows as it stood there, silently smoking. Dorian Marr sat in his red armchair, looking through the floor-to-ceiling window at the waves. He looked at his watch, and snapped his book shut. He then grabbed a bottle of pills from the little table. He took two with a glass . . . .

                        He won’t remember the first dream or the second one. The third may come through only in flashes. The fourth and fifth will meld themselves together to create something odd and mystifying. 

In this narrative nightmare of a dream Tom is running a marathon, right foot forward, left foot forward, sweat dripping, in need of a cup of water. Only he’s not running, is he? He’s lying on the beach, a woman and a child playing next to him in the sand. 

He’s reading a book of poems and stories by Edgar Allen Poe. A Dream Within a Dream, perhaps? A Tell Tale Heart? . . . .
