              <p>Aseem was very excited. He rang the bell. It was midnight of 14th</p>
              <p>February. He was posted in Vishakhapatnam. After 2 years, transfer&nbsp;</p>
              <p>would be due and he would come back to Delhi. The thought of giving&nbsp;</p>
              <p>a surprise to his wife on Valentine’s day was thrilling. His wife loved&nbsp;</p>
              <p>surprises but he believed in planning and organizing. So, there was no&nbsp;</p>
              <p>surprise element in his behavior. He eagerly waited for the door to&nbsp;</p>
              <p>open. He rang the bell thrice before he heard movement inside.</p>
              <p>“ Who is there?” his wife’s sleepy voice came.</p>
              <p>No answer.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>“Is anybody there?”</p>
              <p>He did not answer but rang the bell.</p>
              <p>“Sorry, I will not open the door unless you give your identity.”</p>
              <p>He again rang the bell.</p>
              <p>“Now, if you don’t give your identity and ring the bell again, I will call&nbsp;</p>
              <p>the police.”&nbsp;</p>
              <p>It was better not to involve the police in this surprise.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>“Its me dear,” I said.</p>
              <p>“ Who, me?”</p>
              <p>“Aseem, Pammi dear.”</p>
              <p>“ No mimicry please. Tell me who you are?”</p>
              <p>“ Check my location on your mobile.”</p>
              <p>In two minutes Pammi opened the door and screamed with surprise,&nbsp;</p>
              <p>“ Oh my God. I just can't believe it that you’ve actually come home.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Happy Valentine’s Day dear.”</p>
              <p>“ That was my line but you spoiled all my surprise . I was so excited.</p>
              <p>“ I can understand but you see how could I open the door at midnight&nbsp;</p>
              <p>with two little kids only in the house. I have to think of everyone’s&nbsp;</p>
              <p>safety.” Pammi explained.</p>
              <p>“ Ok. You win.”</p>
              <p>“ Do you want to eat or drink something?”</p>
              <p>“ No. I am tired and want to sleep.”</p>
              <p>“ I'll make your favorite dishes tomorrow to make your day special.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>You made my day by coming here. Now it’s my turn.”</p>
              <p>Aseem spent two days with his family and came back to&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Vishakhapatnam. He had rented a single room set as he was on job all&nbsp;</p>
              <p>the day and most of the weekends he spent with his family or friends.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>His flat was used just to house his personal items.</p>
              <p>When he joined back his office, he came to know that his boss was on&nbsp;</p>
              <p>leave because he was not well. Two days later it was confirmed that&nbsp;</p>
              <p>his boss was corona positive. The whole building was sanitized and all&nbsp;</p>
              <p>the employees were instructed to take special care and follow all&nbsp;</p>
              <p>protocols related to this disease.</p>
              <p>Days passed by. He was working on a project and was very busy. Boss&nbsp;</p>
              <p>was not there so he became the officiating head. For almost a month&nbsp;</p>
              <p>he could not go back to Delhi. He booked air tickets for 27th March and&nbsp;</p>
              <p>kept packing all the things he would not need and could drop them&nbsp;</p>
              <p>back home. He planned to take back most of the winter wear and bring&nbsp;</p>
              <p>back summer wear.</p>
              <p>Then one day Prime Minister Modi announced a complete lockdown&nbsp;</p>
              <p>on 22nd March. There were a few cases of corona in the country and Modi wanted to destroy the virus by breaking the chain. Only&nbsp;</p>
              <p>essential items were available at a fixed time. No one was allowed to&nbsp;</p>
              <p>go out of his house. Absolute silence prevailed. Aseem felt relaxed.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Office work had kept him very busy. He slept the whole day. He&nbsp;</p>
              <p>planned his Delhi visit. He had a long talk with his wife and children.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>They even enjoyed a video call. The schools of his children had closed&nbsp;</p>
              <p>down for a week. The children were happy to be at home. As a treat&nbsp;</p>
              <p>their father came on video call. Both, Ronny and Princy, were excited&nbsp;</p>
              <p>to tell him about their school and why it closed down. Then they</p>
              <p>recited their poems and made him laugh at jokes. The lockdown day&nbsp;</p>
              <p>became a sweet memory for him.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Next day all the employees came back to work. Cases of corona were&nbsp;</p>
              <p>increasing. People got frightful information through social media and&nbsp;</p>
              <p>WhatsApp. No one understood what was happening. All were in a&nbsp;</p>
              <p>hurry to go back in the safety of their home. People said that the&nbsp;</p>
              <p>infection symptoms were of common cold. How could cold become&nbsp;</p>
              <p>deadly? There was no other topic of conversation. People started&nbsp;</p>
              <p>hoarding groceries and vegetables. What would they do if Modi again&nbsp;</p>
              <p>announced a lockdown.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>On 24th evening PM Modi announced a ccomplete lockdown. All flights,&nbsp;</p>
              <p>trains, metros, buses, ceased to operate. All factories, offices,&nbsp;</p>
              <p>markets, cinema halls, coaching centers were shut down. No&nbsp;</p>
              <p>movement was allowed. Only people involved in essential services,&nbsp;</p>
              <p>sanitary workers, health workers and news will be allowed to move&nbsp;</p>
              <p>about. Markets will operate only for essentials. All had to stay where&nbsp;</p>
              <p>they were.</p>
              <p>Aseem was shocked. He lived in a small room alone. What will he do?&nbsp;</p>
              <p>He could not go back. There were no flights and trains. He could not&nbsp;</p>
              <p>go out anywhere. Thank God he could cook. He just hoped the&nbsp;</p>
              <p>lockdown would not be extended and he would soon go back home.</p>
              <p>He got up in the morning. It was 6.30 am. He remembered there was&nbsp;</p>
              <p>no office. He lay down lazily and fell asleep. It was 11.00 am when he&nbsp;</p>
              <p>opened his eyes. He got up, switched on the television and tuned to&nbsp;</p>
              <p>the news channel. The whole day he felt lethargic. Frequently he fell&nbsp;</p>
              <p>asleep. Whenever he got up he thought what date it was.</p>
              <p>The TV channels started popular and interesting mythological serials</p>
              <p>four hours a day and Aseem did not miss any. He had no fixed time of&nbsp;</p>
              <p>sleeping or eating. He had always wanted to watch so many serials&nbsp;</p>
              <p>and movies. He could never spare the time. Now he was free. No office&nbsp;</p>
              <p>work to do. Back to back he watched movies and serials. There was no&nbsp;</p>
              <p>other work to do. He contacted his family anytime of the day. For a&nbsp;</p>
              <p>few days he was happy with this life. It was a blessing in disguise for&nbsp;</p>
              <p>him. He enjoyed everyday. His activities included sleeping, watching&nbsp;</p>
              <p>TV, eating, his elder talking to his family and The only problem was&nbsp;</p>
              <p>that he missed the count of dates. He just couldn’t remember what&nbsp;</p>
              <p>date it was.</p>
              <p>When Aseem got tired of watching TV he switched to reading. One by&nbsp;</p>
              <p>one he read all the books available with him. He also read all the&nbsp;</p>
              <p>newspapers he had in his house. While reading the newspaper Aseem&nbsp;</p>
              <p>imagined that it was that day's newspaper. He looked at the old&nbsp;</p>
              <p>newspaper and wondered why the news in the newspaper and the TV&nbsp;</p>
              <p>was different. He looked at the date and tried to recall the present&nbsp;</p>
              <p>day’s date. How old was the newspaper? Everything seemed to be&nbsp;</p>
              <p>confusing. All twenty four hours the same news of people dying due&nbsp;</p>
              <p>to corona, no beds in the hospitals, no place available cremation&nbsp;</p>
              <p>ground and several places have been isolated for corona patients.</p>
              <p>The news was really depressing for a man who was staying away from&nbsp;</p>
              <p>his family. He just couldn’t remember current dates. He had to check&nbsp;</p>
              <p>his mobile. Then he started crossing out each date as it passed. He&nbsp;</p>
              <p>thought now he would remember dates. But he forgot to cross out&nbsp;</p>
              <p>dates regularly and again got confused. He had never thought that&nbsp;</p>
              <p>remembering dates was such a big deal.</p>
              <p>Now he understood the benefit of a regular daily routine. The&nbsp;</p>
              <p>sequence of events help us remember dates. Our daily routine tells us&nbsp;</p>
              <p>what time of the day it is. If the daily routine is disturbed, the whole&nbsp;</p>
              <p>life of a person is affected. No one could ever imagine that the entire&nbsp;</p>
              <p>population of the world would come to a standstill due to this&nbsp;</p>
              <p>pandemic. This was a situation beyond the imagination of anyone.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>People had to stay away from all others to be healthy. All the people&nbsp;</p>
              <p>took pills regularly to increase their immunity. Hand wash and&nbsp;</p>
              <p>sanitizers disappeared from the market. Then masks became&nbsp;</p>
              <p>mandatory.</p>
              <p>Aseem was lost in his own house. Dates confused him. He felt hot. He&nbsp;</p>
              <p>needed shorts and T shirts. All he had were woolen pajamas and full&nbsp;</p>
              <p>sleeves shirts. Why he couldn’t find his summer wear he couldn’t&nbsp;</p>
              <p>understand. He asked his wife the reason. She replied that he had&nbsp;</p>
              <p>come home only in winter. He needed to come home to collect his&nbsp;</p>
              <p>summer wear. He tried to find out how many days were summer to&nbsp;</p>
              <p>be over. He couldn’t count.</p>
              <p>The government started removing restrictions and trains started.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Aseem booked his seat and came home. It took fifteen days for him to&nbsp;</p>
              <p>completely recover from loneliness and become normal.</p>
              <p> </p>
