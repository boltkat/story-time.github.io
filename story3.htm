            <article class="font-alt submission-content space-top-xs-md space-bottom-xs-lg">
              <p>“Luna!” A muffled voice shouts in the distance. At first, she opens her eyes slightly, the sun warming her black fur. Her nose brushes over her paw, which makes her lick the smooth surface in drowsy motions. “Lunaaa!” Clair is calling her. Luna perks her ears up and dugs herself out of Miss Fine’s bushes. She would let a bowl of milk for Luna on the window ledge, and when Luna would lick the liquid in slow movements, Miss Fine would come and pet her gently.</p><p>It is not dinner time yet, but Clair hasn’t seen Luna since morning, and Luna knows how anxious Clair gets if she is missing for too long. Luna saunters on the sidewalk to her house. The faint afternoon sun is gilding Clair’s orange hair. Her big eyes look up and down the street, trying to spot Luna’s black fur.</p><p>“There you are!” Clair smiles with her whole teeth at the sight of her.</p><p>Luna decides to let out a short ‘meow’ to let Clair know she knows why Clair is calling her. As she is getting closer, she rushes her steps because a sudden urge to be petted took over her. Just as expected, Clair picks her up and caresses her back with pressed motions, but not too hard either, just the way Luna likes it. She puts her head unto Clair’s chest, which in return makes Clair squeal of happiness. After black fur flies in the sun’s rays, Luna is put to the ground once again.</p><p>She takes a look up at Clair, before turning around and leaving in the direction of the swamp. She told Meek she would go hang out with him in the afternoon, and he is probably waiting for her already.</p><p>&nbsp;On the way to the forest, a couple of children try to grab her, but Luna is no fool—she knows not to let strangers approach her, unless she sees them talking with Clair first. Luna knows Clair is to be trusted, because she feeds and pets her.</p><p>The grass is still damp under her paws from yesterday’s rain. It feels just like the rug in the living room, the white one. The sun is still warm, but the leaves started turning orange, yellow and a sickish green. Luna hates autumn because of the rainy days; she can’t stand getting her paws dirty with mud. The summer just ended, and these last few weeks of sunny weather need to be taken advantage of.</p><p>She jumps over a fallen tree and rushes along it, until the swamp comes into view from behind the birches. The green muddy water always made Luna squeamish, but Meek is her only friend in the neighborhood. Well, except for Lucy, the pigeon, but she barely sees her since she laid eggs.</p><p>Luna wobbles gracefully along the water, only for her to bump right into Meek, who is camouflaged in the mud.</p><p>“Dear Heavens!” Luna exclaims. “You almost scared one life out of me!”</p><p>Meek starts giggling, his little eyes lighting up at the sight of Luna. His rough, alligator skin gleams under the late summer sun.</p><p>“It took you awhile!” He responds.</p><p>“I fell asleep.” She says while licking her paw, but instantly regretting it, because it is full of dirt.</p><p>“What do you want to do today?” Meek asks her with eagerness.</p><p>Luna glances along the lake with squinting eyes, still feeling drowsy from the afternoon nap.</p><p>“Would you care for a stroll along the river?”</p><p>“Anything you want!”</p><p>His skin feels cold underneath Luna’s paws. She tries to steady herself on his back, trying not to fall into the water like the first time. Meek crawls with a surgeon’s care into the lake, trying not to disturb in any way Luna’s light body.</p><p>Trees hang their branches in the water, bending underneath the imperceptible breeze. The decaying greenery whispers their last goodbyes before cold arrives. Meek is a master in avoiding thick fallen branches, because in his free time he practices. He would never dare tell that to Luna, but he was doing it in order to make her rides smoother. Before, Luna would complain: “Meek, you’re going too fast! The water gets in my fur! Clair will bathe me again, and you know how much I hate that!” But this time, a faint purr would resonate from his back. Meek felt very proud of himself.</p><p>“Meek, don’t you ever get lonely here?”</p><p>The quietness surrounding them is disrupted only by crickets and the murmur of the water as they pass by.</p><p>“Why would I ever get lonely, Luna? The swamp is alive, I am never alone.” After a short pause, he continues: “Plus, I have you.”</p><p>Luna blinks once, glancing to her right, then to her left.</p><p>“You know I won’t be able to come here once the rains will come.”</p><p>“Time is a breeze of wind if you don’t fixate on it. The thought that I will see you again makes it worthwhile.”</p><p>Luna closes her eyes in a slow, pressing motion, her purring accentuating. Tearing gusts appear out of nowhere, making her almost fall into the water. Wind howls, making the forest snap and clatter, as if the trees will be ripped from their roots and fall from the sky. A loud scream tears the air to smithereens, accompanying the gushing light rain. Luna’s pupils get bigger.</p><p>“What was that?” Luna asks.</p><p>“I have no idea.” Meek answers with urgency.</p><p>A pink silhouette appears to be running between the birches, with three dark ones following it.</p><p>“Someone is in danger!” Luna gasps. “We need to see what is going on.”</p><p>Meek becomes reluctant, his muscles tensing underneath Luna’s paws.</p><p>“We know better than to get involved in human affairs.”</p><p>“But…!”</p><p>“Help!” A loud cry interrupts her.</p><p>“Meek, go to the shore!”</p><p>He absolutely does not want to go to the shore, but he can’t say ‘no’ to her. Just as they get on land, Luna jumps from his back, only for the pink crying silhouette to trip and fall in the mud just a few inches away from them.</p><p>It is a child, with golden hair and a pink jumper. Three other kids are following her with sticks and rocks in their hands, shouting at unison: “Witch! Witch!” The girl on the ground starts crying with loud whimpers. Luna is vivid. Her fur is electrified on her back, her pointy teeth are showing while loud hissing sounds make the four children turn to her.</p><p>“Look, she brought her cat! Kill her!”</p><p>Luna did not have enough time to react to the rock coming at full speed towards her head. She falls on the ground, the sky spinning. A black void of anger clouds Meek’s judgement. He plunges at full speed towards the children, who start screaming their throats out. Birds fly above their heads, disturbed by the sight. The three boys run away, one of them tripping and falling, getting up and continuing to scream while following the others.</p><p>The little girl bulges her blue eyes at Meek. She is breathing heavily, but Meek doesn’t care about her—he is already besides Luna.</p><p>“NO!” He shouts. “Please, tell me you are fine!”</p><p>Luna clambers unsteadily, while Meek tries to help her up with his nose.</p><p>“My fur.” Luna says in a weary tone. “Clair will bathe me again.”</p><p>“Here! I can clean you!” The child gets up from the ground, taking off her cardigan.</p><p>Meek and Luna stare at her in bafflement.</p><p>“You can hear us?” They ask in unison.</p><p>“Y-yes.” She whispers with her cardigan spread in front of her. “My name is Angela. The kids were right about me. I am broken.”</p><p>“Oh honey, being a unicorn among horses doesn’t mean you are broken.” Luna says.</p><p>The girl’s face lights up with a smile.</p><p>“I think I saw you in the neighborhood. You are Miss Clair’s cat, right?”</p><p>“Yes, I am!” Luna answers with pride.</p><p>“Will you allow me to take you home?”</p><p>The wind becomes a breeze, while the rain falls in thin drops, enveloping them in a pearly coat.</p><p>“Do you really have to go, Luna?” Asks Meek.</p><p>Luna glances down at her damp fur.</p><p>“Maybe there’s no need to hurry home.” She concludes.</p><p>“May I join you?” Angela asks meekly.</p><p class="ql-align-center">***</p><p>The three of them fill the swamp with laughter and squeals of happiness as they run up and down, all around, splashing each other with water, playing hide and seek and carrying Luna over deep waters. By the end, when their energy runs out, Angela and Luna are as filled with muddy water as Meek is.</p><p>Angela swaddles Luna in her cardigan, and make their way home after Meek accompanies them as far as he could. The sky clears in a creamy pink shade, revealing the sunset.</p><p>“I’m so happy I have met you.” Angela breathes heavily.</p><p>“You are our friend now.” Luna concludes.</p><p>They are walking down the street towards Luna’s house, when she starts to squirm in Angela’s arms.</p><p>“You should let me down here. Clair will ask you all kinds of questions.”</p><p>Angela puts her down on the pavement after a car goes full speed, making the water in a puddle splash in their direction. Luna starts shivering, the thought of a warm bath and food making her rush her steps towards the door.</p><p>“Bye, Angela! See you tomorrow!”</p><p>Angela waves goodbye as Luna climbs the living room window, where an orange light lures her in. Clair spots her immediately, running for the door.</p><p>“Dear God! My poor baby, where have you been!”</p><p>She takes Luna in her arms despite her fur almost dripping with dirt, and takes her straight to the bathroom.</p><p>As the water is filling the tub, Clair brings Luna a can of cat food.</p><p>“I wish you could tell me where have you been.” Clair whispers to herself.</p><p>“And I wish you could hear me.” Luna answers.</p><p>The only thing Clair is seeing, are a pair of green emerald eyes looking up at her.</p>
